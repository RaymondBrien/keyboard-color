[ ]: accept all string.printable items
[ ]: paramaterize tests for all string printable items - this should pass
[ ]: show color live, updating with default when no user input. Have default state of updating every 0.5 seconds. Can this be pygame or is there a more lightweight way?
[ ]: write a test for showing color live, and default values

# tests to write:
    # check display falls back gracefully if invalid rgb
    # how does RGB class handle losing contact with display?
    # how does display handle different tuple feed regularities? eg every 0.5 seconds, every 0.1s, every minute, series of repeats, does that break?
